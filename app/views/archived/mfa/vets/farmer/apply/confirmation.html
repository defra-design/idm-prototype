      <p class="govuk-body">The vet will contact you to organise testing of your livestock. They will test for:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy and beef cattle</li>
        <li>how effective worming treatments are in sheep</li>
        <li>porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRS) in pigs</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">The vet will discuss the test results and treatment options with you when they visit.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Farm visit</h3>

      <p>The vet will visit your farm to carry out the review. Discuss with the vet what you want to focus on.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Confirm the record and get paid</h3>

      <p>After the vet has recorded information about the review,
        you’ll receive an <a href="../claim/start-email">email</a> asking you to confirm the record is correct.
        Sign in to confirm the record and claim funding for an annual health and welfare review of your livestock.
