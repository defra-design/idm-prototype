    <p class="govuk-body">Defra will pay farmers to have an annual vet-led health and welfare review if they keep beef or dairy cattle, sheep or pigs.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The aim of the review is to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>reduce endemic diseases and conditions</li>
      <li>increase animal productivity</li>
      <li>improve animal welfare</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">The review is not an inspection or audit and it is optional.</p>
<!--
    <p class="govuk-body">The review will:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>not be an inspection or audit</li>
      <li>take approximately 3 hours- this includes your time, the farmer's time, and time for testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">It's the farmer's responsibility to pay you once the review is complete.</p>
-->
  <h2 id="howmuchforfarmer" class="govuk-heading-m">How much funding a farmer will get</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Farmers will get funding for each livestock type, not for each animal. They’ll get:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>
      <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>
      <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>
      <li>£684 for a pig review</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This funding will help cover the costs for:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the farmer’s time</li>
      <li>endemic diseases and conditions testing</li>
      <li>your time</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The funding amount for each type of livestock is different because:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>testing may take longer for some types of livestock</li>
      <li>some results cost more to analyse</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="howtoreview" class="govuk-heading-m">How to carry out a review</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The farmer will contact you to arrange a review and give you a booking reference number.
      You'll need this reference number to record information after the review.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You should agree with the farmer when you’ll carry out the review and what you’ll check.
      You can spread the review over several regular visits to the farm or do it in a single visit.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The review can take up to 3 hours of your time and the farmer’s time.
      It can be flexible, so you can focus on the most important things for the farm.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Some parts of the review are required and some are optional.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must visit the farm and test for:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy and beef cattle</li>
      <li>the effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep</li>
      <li>porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must discuss the test results and follow-up actions with the farmer.
      Work with the farmer to improve the health and productivity of their animals.
      Give advice where there are issues such as lameness, body conditioning or mobility scoring.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to test for other medical conditions or diseases.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Follow guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="#">testing for priority endemic diseases and conditions.</a></p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Depending on the farm, you may choose to review:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>biosecurity measures on the farm and suggest recommendations for improvements</li>
      <li>farm medicines, including antibiotics, vaccinations and  how to register and submit data on the <a class="govuk-link" href="#">Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Medicine Hub</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">At the end of the review you must give the farmer a written report.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This will include agreed recommendations and actions you or the farmer can take to improve the health and welfare of the livestock - for example, a 5-point lameness plan.</p>


  <h2 id="review" class="govuk-heading-m">After the review</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">After the review, you, or a member of your team, must record information about the review.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="start">record information about a review online</a></p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Recording information takes around 5 minutes.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">After you submit the information, the farmer can claim funding.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You should invoice the farmer using your normal process. Your invoice must include the costs for:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>endemic diseases and conditions testing</li>
      <li>your time</li>
    </ul>
<!--
      {{ govukButton({
          text: "Start now",
          href: "../../vet/passwordless/start",
          isStartButton: true
        }) }}
-->

  <h2 id="record" class="govuk-heading-m">Information to record and share</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">You must share some information you’ve recorded with Defra. You need to confirm:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>livestock type reviewed</li>
    <li>number of animals reviewed</li>
    <li>priority disease or endemic condition test results</li>
    <li>you’ve given the farmer the written report - do not share the report itself</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">Test result information will help Defra get a better understanding of the health and welfare of the national herds and flocks.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">The information:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>will be anonymised and stored securely online</li>
    <li>will not be used for site visits or other compliance checks</li>
  </ul>
