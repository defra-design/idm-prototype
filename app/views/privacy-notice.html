        <p class="govuk-body">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (including its agencies and public bodies) has a duty to protect the public funds it administers, and to this end may use the information provided by its customers and suppliers for the prevention and detection of fraud. It may also share this information with other bodies responsible for auditing or administering public funds for these purposes.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Purpose of this Privacy Notice</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">This notice is provided within the context of the changes required by the Article 13 & 14 of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). This notice sets out how we will use your personal data as part of our legal obligations about Data Protection.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs/about/personal-information-charter" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Our personal information charter (opens in new tab)</a> explains how we deal with your information. It also explains how you can ask to view, change, or remove your information from our databases.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why you need to create a new set of sign in details</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">We ask you to create a single set of sign in details to save you time. You will be able to use them to register with and access several different services provided by Defra and our related agencies and public bodies. We will store basic information about you (and your business, if relevant) so that you do not have to re-enter the information each time you want to use a new online service.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you have administrator access, you will also be able to give other people (for example colleagues or agents you work with) access to one or more of the online services you use.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your information will be shared with all the administrators associated with your account for them to manage the access to one or more of the online services you use.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">When you create your new sign in detail and register for Your Defra account, you will interact with two different government departments:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>HMRC to create a Government Gateway account (unless you already have one, in which case you will be directed to sign in)</li>
            <li>Defra to create your new sign in detail and register for Your Defra account</li>
