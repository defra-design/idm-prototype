    <!-- Intro -->
    <p class="govuk-body">
      As a farmer you can get funding for a vet or vet-led team
      to visit your farm to do a health and welfare review if you keep:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>beef cattle</li>
      <li>dairy cattle</li>
      <li>sheep</li>
      <li>pigs</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can have one review each year for one type of livestock.
      If you have more than one type of livestock, you must choose the one that you would like reviewed.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">A health and welfare review will help you:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>reduce endemic diseases and conditions</li>
      <li>increase animal productivity</li>
      <li>improve animal welfare</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The review will not be an inspection or be used for compliance or monitoring.
      The review is optional.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can choose the vet that you want to do the review.</p>

    <!-- Main body -->
    <h2 id="howmuchpaid" class="govuk-heading-m">How much funding you’ll get</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get funding for each livestock type, not for each animal.
        You’ll get:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>
        <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>
        <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>
        <li>£684 for a pig review</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">This funding will help you cover the costs for:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the vet</li>
        <li>endemic diseases and conditions testing</li>
        <li>your time</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        This funding will cover the endemic disease and condition testing costs
        and will contribute towards the costs for:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the vet’s time</li>
        <li>the farmer’s time</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="checkeligibility" class="govuk-heading-m">Check you're eligible for a review</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must have a minimum number of animals on the date the vet will visit your farm to do the review.
        You must have at least:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>11 beef cattle</li>
        <li>11 dairy cattle</li>
        <li>21 sheep</li>
        <li>51 pigs</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">The livestock must be registered in England and you must be the registered keeper.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You must be eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).
        To be eligible for BPS the farm or business must have at least:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>5 hectares (ha) of BPS eligible land</li>
        <li>5 BPS entitlements on 16 May 2022</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your farm or business must also have a Single Business Identifier (SBI).</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can apply for a review if you have also applied for lump sum payment to leave or retire from farming.
      </p>

    <h2 id="whattoexpect" class="govuk-heading-m">What to expect from a review</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The review can take up to 3 hours of your time and the vet’s time.
        You can agree with the vet to spread it over several regular visits to the farm or do it all in one visit.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The vet will also discuss one or more of the following as part of the review:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>health and welfare, including issues such as lameness, body conditioning or mobility scoring</li>
        <li>biosecurity, including internal and external biosecurity recommendations</li>
        <li>
          medicine usage, including antibiotics, vaccinations and how you can register and submit data on the
          <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/medicine-hub" target="_blank">Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Medicine Hub</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You do not need to cover all of these areas.
        The review is flexible, so you can focus on the most important areas in the 2 to 3 hours the vet visits you.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should agree with the vet:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>when they’ll carry out the review</li>
        <li>what they’ll do</li>
        <li>what you’ll discuss</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Endemic disease and condition testing</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The vet will test for:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy and beef cattle</li>
          <li>the effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep</li>
          <li>porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRS) in pigs</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You can use these test results for other accreditation schemes you’re a member of. Y
          ou cannot use other accreditation scheme test results to apply for funding.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The vet will not test for other medical conditions or diseases as part of the review.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          If you’re already testing for these diseases or conditions, you can arrange a review so that it fits with your schedule.
          For example, if you recently carried out testing, wait until the next time you need to do it to take advantage of the review.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          To find out more about testing you can read the
          <a href="guidance-technical">technical guidance on disease and endemic condition testing</a>.
        </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Written report</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          After the vet has completed the review, they’ll give you a written report.
          The report should explain:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>endemic disease or condition testing results</li>
          <li>
            other review findings - for example, biosecurity recommendations, medicine usage advice
            or suggested species-specific health and welfare actions
          </li>
          <li>
            agreed achievable actions to address issues raised by the review or testing
            - likely to be 2 to 3 but can be more or less based on individual needs
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="infoshare" class="govuk-heading-m">Information the vet will record and share</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The vet must record and share some information about the review with Defra.
        The vet will share with Defra:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>date of farm visit</li>
        <li>livestock type reviewed</li>
        <li>number of animals reviewed</li>
        <li>endemic disease or condition test results</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The vet will also confirm with Defra that they’ve given you a written report.
        The written report you get from the vet will not be shared with Defra
        or used for site visits or other compliance checks.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Test result information will help Defra get a better understanding
        of the health and welfare of the national herds and flocks.
        The information:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>will be anonymised and stored securely online</li>
        <li>will not be used for site visits or other compliance checks</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="whenpaid" class="govuk-heading-m">When you'll be paid</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        After the vet has recorded the review with Defra, you’ll get an email asking you to confirm the record is correct.
        Sign in to confirm the record and submit your claim.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll receive a payment within 28 days of confirming the record.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        It’s your responsibility to pay the vet when the review is complete.
        The vet’s invoice will include any testing costs.
