            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to register for Defra online services</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">To register for a Defra online service for the first time, you need to create a Defra account. Your Defra account lets you register with a range of online services from Defra and related organisations.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Here’s the process:</p>
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                <li>Sign in using your own Government Gateway username and password. If you do not have your own Government Gateway account, we’ll help you to create one. Do not use a shared account.</li>
                <li>Tell us some information about you and your organisation (if relevant).</li>
                <li>Complete your registration with the relevant service.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>your email address, phone number and postal address</li>
                <li>your Government Gateway user ID and password. If you do not have a Government Gateway account, we’ll help you to create one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you’re registering on behalf of a business or organisation, you’ll also need:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>the main contact details for your business or organisation (for example, head office contact details)</li>
                <li>the Companies House number if the business or organisation is a limited company</li>
